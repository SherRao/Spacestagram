# Spacestagram | Image-sharing from the final frontier
This is my submission for the Summer 2022 Frontend Intern Challenge.

You can demo the project here! -> [spacestagram.sherrao.tech](https://spacestagram.sherrao.tech)

## Technical
This project used JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. React was used as the main frontend framework while
Firebase Firestore (v9) was as the serverless backend. Refer to the [package.json](https://github.com/SherRao/Spacestagram/blob/main/package.json) for a
comprehsive list of libraries used.

## UI
* This project used the [Polaris React Component Library](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react) to create the User Interface.
